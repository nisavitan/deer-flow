## Requirements & capability check (optional module - run this FIRST)

This skill is a **DeerFlow optional module**. It ships disabled: the DeerFlow Claude Code
port has no external providers of its own, and this skill cannot do its job without the
capability listed below.

**Before doing anything else, run the check. Do not start the workflow, do not improvise a
substitute, and do not fabricate output.**

Required: `MINIMAX_API_KEY` (MiniMax music API) plus Python 3 for `scripts/generate.py`.

```bash
test -n "$MINIMAX_API_KEY" || echo "MISSING: MINIMAX_API_KEY"
```

If the check fails, **STOP immediately** and tell the user, in plain terms:

1. exactly what is missing (name the environment variables / tools above);
2. how to provide it - for a missing API key, export the variable in the shell that
   launches Claude Code (or add it to the project environment); for a missing tool, run
   against a host that provides it (for example an MCP server) - then restart the session;
3. how to enable this module if it is not installed yet - copy
   `ports/claude-code/skills-optional/music-generation/` into the project's `.claude/skills/music-generation/`
   (or into `~/.claude/skills/music-generation/` for personal scope), or enable it through your
   Claude Code settings, then restart the session.

Then end your turn. Nothing below this section runs until the check passes.

When the check passes, set the path variables used by the commands below to the directory
this `SKILL.md` was loaded from:

```bash
SKILL_DIR=<absolute path of the directory containing this SKILL.md>
```

# Music Generation Skill

## Overview

This skill generates songs (vocal or instrumental) from a structured JSON spec using the
MiniMax music generation API (`/v1/music_generation`). You describe the style/mood/scene in
`prompt`, optionally provide `lyrics`, and the script returns an MP3.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Requirements

Identify the desired style, mood, scene, language, and whether the user wants vocals or a
pure instrumental track. Decide whether to supply lyrics or let the model write them.

### Step 2: Create the Spec JSON

Write a JSON file in `workspace/` named `{descriptive-name}.json`:

```json
{
  "title": "Rainy Night Cafe",
  "prompt": "indie folk, melancholic, introspective, walking alone, cafe",
  "lyrics": "[verse]\nStreetlights glow the night wind sighs\n[chorus]\nPush the wooden door warm air inside"
}
```

Fields:
- `title` (optional): a human-readable name.
- `prompt` (required): style, mood, and scene. Drives the musical character.
- `lyrics` (optional): song lyrics. Use `\n` between lines and structure tags such as
  `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Pre Chorus]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Outro]`.
- `is_instrumental` (optional, bool): set `true` for a pure instrumental track (no lyrics needed).

Behavior:
- `lyrics` provided → those lyrics are sung.
- `is_instrumental: true` → instrumental, no vocals.
- neither → the model auto-writes lyrics from `prompt` (`lyrics_optimizer`).

### Step 3: Execute Generation

```bash
python "$SKILL_DIR"/scripts/generate.py \
  --prompt-file workspace/rainy-night-cafe.json \
  --output-file outputs/rainy-night-cafe.mp3
```

Parameters:
- `--prompt-file`: Absolute path to the JSON spec (required).
- `--output-file`: Absolute path for the output MP3 (required).

[!NOTE]
Do NOT read the python file, just call it with the parameters.

## Environment

- `MINIMAX_API_KEY` (required): your MiniMax interface key.
- `MINIMAX_API_HOST` (optional): default `https://api.minimaxi.com`.
- `MINIMAX_MUSIC_MODEL` (optional): default `music-2.6-free` (works for all API-key users);
  paid/Token-Plan users can set `music-2.6` for higher limits.

## Output Handling

- Music is saved as MP3 (typically in `outputs/`).
- Share the generated file with the user by listing its path in your final message.
- Offer to iterate on style or lyrics if adjustments are needed.

## Notes

- Keep `prompt` focused on style/mood/scene; put the actual sung words in `lyrics`.
- For non-English songs, write `lyrics` in the target language.
